When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are committing in someone elseâ€™s work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because you might make changes that are not ready to be passed to your computer yet.
