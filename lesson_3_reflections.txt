When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are committing in someone elseâ€™s work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because you might make changes that are not ready to be passed to your computer yet.

forks are used to clone data inside the github, clones create copies of entire repositories inside your computer or from github to your computer, branches are the different paths that a particular commit can take.
